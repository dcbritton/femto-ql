This file contains the current grammar of the query language.

For reference:
LHS is always a non-terminal symbol.
RHS contains the sequence of terminal (tokens) and/or non-terminal symbols that make up the non-terminal on the left.
The | symbol indicates that a non-terminal may be composed of either one sequence or the other.
